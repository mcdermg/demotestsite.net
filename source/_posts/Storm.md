The first problem. It seems like my internet provider locks all ports but 22 (SSH). What a pain and didn't find a workaround just yet. You would think in the age of the internet of things that more ports would be available. From a little bit of research that I did it would seem that the company in question would like you to upgrade to a business account to open up more ports. The model for internet and mobile phone providers in North America appears to be squeeze as much out of you, I have seen a million posts online about how shitty they are but never encountered it until today.

When I looked on the router I found that ports 4343 and 1000 were already setup in port forwarding settings so it seems like I can use these in the meantime or indefinitely. It is strange though as home CCTV, smart door bells and a bout a thousand other use cases are out there for regular people so I will try and follow up to see if anything can be done. But for now I have 3 ports that I can use for each of the Pi's.
